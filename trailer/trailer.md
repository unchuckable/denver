| Maintenance on an aerial drone (Body 2) | r3.120 | 512 |

### Considerations

#### Space 

The current design seems rather low-priced, as well as having too low an availability and lacks the possibility of performing maintenance on vehicles inside.

Possible Fix: Increase CF Capacity:

| | Source | CF | Load | DP | Nuyen Cost (SI included) | 
|-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|
| Chassis | | 1200 | 10000 | 160 | - |
| Increased Cargo Space | r3.300 | 300 | - | 1500 | - | 
| Extra Entry Points (rear ramp plus side door) | r3.115 | - | - | - | - |
| Living Amenities (High, 2Persons) | r3.p119 | -24 | - | 180 | - |
| People space (2 persons) | r3.120 | -162 | -300 | - | - |
| SunCell Power | - | - | 5 | - |
| Vehicle Shop | r3.120 | -52 | -250 | - | 10000 |
| **Total** | | 1262 | 9445 | 1840 | 10000 |

**Total Cost Calculation**: 184'000 Nuyen + 10000 Nuyen = **194'000 Nuyen**

**SI**: 3 (Built-to-Order special purpose)

#### Shop vs Facility

Including a facility in a vehicle would impose a lot larger storage requirements, if maintenance inside this trailer is still desired. Even with maximum CF extension, the vehicle would still end up about 300 CF short of required size. And actually, that might make sense, for racing trucks will likely have all the facilities required to perform repairs and small adjustments to the car, but not to do groundbreaking adaptions to the vehicle. For that, a stationary facility might be the better option.

##### Example calculation for a racing trailer with a facility

| | Source | CF | Load | DP | Nuyen Cost (SI included) | 
|-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|
| Chassis | | 1200 | 10000 | 160 | - |
| Increased Cargo Space | r3.300 | 400 | - | 2000 | - | 
| Extra Entry Points (rear ramp plus side door) | r3.115 | - | - | - | - |
| Living Amenities (High, 2Persons) | r3.p119 | -24 | - | 180 | - |
| People space (2 persons) | r3.120 | -162 | -300 | - | - |
| SunCell Power | - | - | 5 | - |
| Vehicle Facility | r3.120 | -500 | -1000 | 250 | 200'000 |
| **Total** | | 915 | 9445 | 2590 | 200'000 |

**Total Cost Calculation**: 259'000 Nuyen + 200'000 Nuyen = **459'000 Nuyen**
**SI**: 4 (the SI of the Facility)
